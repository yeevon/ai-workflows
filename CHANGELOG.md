## [Unreleased]

### Added — M1 Task 01: Project Scaffolding

Initial project skeleton built on the `pydantic-ai` ecosystem. Establishes
the three-layer architecture (primitives → components → workflows) and the
tooling that enforces it. No runtime behaviour yet — that lands in M1
Tasks 02–12.

- **`pyproject.toml`**
  - Runtime deps: `pydantic-ai`, `pydantic-graph`, `pydantic-evals`,
    `logfire`, `anthropic`, `httpx`, `pydantic`, `pyyaml`, `structlog`,
    `typer`, `yoyo-migrations`.
  - Optional `dag` extra for `networkx` (installed in M4).
  - Dev group: `import-linter`, `pytest`, `pytest-asyncio`, `ruff`.
  - Console script: `aiw = ai_workflows.cli:app`.
  - Two `import-linter` contracts encoding the layer rules:
    1. primitives cannot import components or workflows
    2. components cannot import workflows

    A third contract ("components cannot peek at each other's private
    state") is documented in the Task 01 spec but is **deferred**:
    `import-linter`'s wildcard syntax only allows `*` to replace a whole
    module segment, so `components.*._*` is rejected at load time.
    The rule comes back in M2 Task 01 when components exist and their
    private modules can be enumerated.
  - `ruff` defaults: line length 100, py312 target, rule set
    `E,F,I,UP,B,SIM`.
  - `pytest-asyncio` set to `auto` mode.
- **Package layout** (`ai_workflows/`)
  - `ai_workflows/__init__.py` — exposes `__version__` and documents the
    layering rule.
  - `ai_workflows/cli.py` — minimal Typer app with `--help` and a
    `version` subcommand. Subcommand groups land in M1 Task 12.
  - `ai_workflows/primitives/__init__.py` plus `llm/` and `tools/`
    subpackages (empty modules, filled in by Tasks 02–11).
  - `ai_workflows/components/__init__.py` (filled by M2 + M4).
  - `ai_workflows/workflows/__init__.py` (filled by M3, M5, M6).
- **Configuration stubs**
  - `tiers.yaml` — empty `tiers: {}` map; real schema lands in Task 07.
  - `pricing.yaml` — empty `models: {}` map; populated by Task 09.
- **Migrations**
  - `migrations/001_initial.sql` — bootstrap migration so `yoyo apply` has
    a tracked history on day one. Task 08 lands the real schema as 002+.
- **CI** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
  - `test` job: `uv sync`, `uv run pytest`, `uv run lint-imports`,
    `uv run ruff check`.
  - `secret-scan` job: greps committed config for `sk-ant-…` patterns and
    fails the build if any are found.
- **Tests** (`tests/test_scaffolding.py`) — acceptance tests for Task 01:
  - All three layers + the CLI module import cleanly.
  - `aiw --help` and `aiw version` succeed via `typer.testing.CliRunner`.
  - Required scaffolding files exist on disk.
  - `pyproject.toml` declares every dependency from the Task 01 spec, the
    `aiw` console script, and the three `import-linter` contracts.
  - `lint-imports` exits 0 (skipped when `import-linter` is not
    installed).

### Notes

- `.python-version` pins to 3.13 (target runtime); `pyproject.toml`
  declares `>=3.12` so the project still builds on the user's laptop where
  3.12 is installed.
- `.gitignore` already excludes `runs/`, `*.db*`, `tiers.local.yaml`, and
  `.env*` — left untouched by this task.
