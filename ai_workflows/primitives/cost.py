"""Cost tracking, budget enforcement, and the CostTracker implementation.

Hosts :class:`TokenUsage` as the canonical token-count record (relocated
here by M1 Task 03 when the pre-pivot ``primitives.llm.types`` module was
deleted; :class:`TokenUsage` is a plain pydantic v2 model with no
pydantic-ai coupling, and ``cost`` is its only remaining consumer per
[architecture.md §4.1](../../design_docs/architecture.md)). Field shape
and tracker API will be pruned in M1 Task 08 per KDR-007.

Responsibilities
----------------
* :class:`TokenUsage` — per-call input/output/cache token counts; the
  shared record every adapter emits and every aggregator consumes.
* :func:`calculate_cost` — pure function that multiplies a ``TokenUsage``
  by a ``ModelPricing`` row and divides by 1e6. Returns ``0.0`` for models
  not in the pricing table (with a structured WARNING) so a missing entry
  never crashes a workflow.
* :class:`BudgetExceeded` — the exception the tracker raises when a run's
  total cost crosses ``budget_cap_usd``. Carries ``run_id``,
  ``current_cost``, and ``cap`` so the Pipeline / Orchestrator can log the
  failure and mark the run ``failed`` with reason ``budget_exceeded``. M1
  Task 08 will replace this with the ``NonRetryable`` bucket from
  [task 07](../../design_docs/phases/milestone_1_reconciliation/task_07_refit_retry_policy.md).
* :class:`CostTracker` — concrete implementation. Wraps a
  :class:`~ai_workflows.primitives.storage.StorageBackend`, a pricing
  mapping, and an optional ``budget_cap_usd``. Every ``record()`` call
  persists one ``llm_calls`` row and re-runs the ``get_total_cost`` SUM
  aggregate; if the new total crosses the cap, :class:`BudgetExceeded`
  fires **after** the row is written so the run log preserves the exact
  state at the moment of the budget breach.

Design notes
------------
* Running total is never cached in the tracker — we always ask the storage
  backend via ``get_total_cost``, so a second ``CostTracker`` that mounts
  the same DB reads the true aggregate.
* ``runs.total_cost_usd`` is intentionally **not** stamped from within
  ``record()``. The Pipeline / Orchestrator stamps it once on terminal
  state via ``storage.update_run_status("completed", total_cost_usd=...)``.
  The tracker's source of truth is the ``llm_calls`` SUM aggregate; the
  column is a denormalised cache filled at run end.

See also
--------
* ``primitives/tiers.py`` — :class:`ModelPricing` and ``load_pricing()``.
* ``primitives/storage.py`` — :class:`StorageBackend` methods the tracker
  relies on (``log_llm_call``, ``get_total_cost``, ``get_cost_breakdown``).
