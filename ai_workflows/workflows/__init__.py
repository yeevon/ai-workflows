"""Workflows layer — concrete workflow definitions + name registry.

Each module in here exports a built LangGraph ``StateGraph`` per
[architecture.md §4.3](../../design_docs/architecture.md); a workflow
is a Python module, not a directory of YAML + prompts. Graph instances
are registered by name so surfaces (``aiw`` CLI, MCP server) can reach
them.

Initial workflows (filled in over M3, M5, M6):

* ``planner`` (M3) — two-phase sub-graph (explorer → planner →
  validator); reusable as a sub-graph.
* ``slice_refactor`` (M5) — outermost DAG wiring the ``planner``
  sub-graph to parallel per-slice worker nodes.
* ``jvm_modernization`` (M6) — the original motivating use case.

The pre-pivot reference to a ``workflow_hash`` drift guard has been
retired per [ADR-0001](../../design_docs/adr/0001_workflow_hash.md);
if ``aiw resume`` eventually needs a source-code drift guard, it will
be designed against the module-based shape in M3, not the directory
hash.

## Registry (M3 Task 01)

Surfaces reach workflows by string id through :func:`register` /
:func:`get` / :func:`list_workflows`. Workflow modules self-register
at *import* time; callers (e.g. ``aiw run``) import the module first,
then resolve the builder by name.

``WorkflowBuilder`` is intentionally typed as ``Callable[[], Any]``.
``StateGraph`` lives in ``langgraph.graph``, but the workflows package
must not import LangGraph at module load — doing so would pull a
graph-layer dependency into the surfaces-adjacent layer. Surfaces call
``builder()`` and hand the result straight to LangGraph, so no typing
crosses the boundary.

Architectural rule: workflows are the top of the stack. Nothing imports
from this package — it's strictly an entry-point layer.

## External workflow discovery (M16 Task 01)

Downstream consumers register their own workflow modules via dotted
Python paths through :data:`ai_workflows.workflows.loader.ENV_VAR_NAME`
(``AIW_EXTRA_WORKFLOW_MODULES``) or the ``--workflow-module`` CLI flag
on both surfaces. :func:`load_extra_workflow_modules` imports each
entry once at startup; the module's top-level :func:`register` call
fires as a side effect. :class:`ExternalWorkflowImportError` (a
subclass of :class:`ImportError`) surfaces import failures with a
single actionable message. See KDR-013 / ADR-0007 for the
user-owned-code contract.
